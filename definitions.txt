OOP: OOP is a programming pattern that organizes code into objects, each representing an entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions). It helps make your code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.


Key Concepts of OOP:

Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) of the objects.

Object: An instance of a class. It can hold data and interact with other objects or methods.

Attributes: Variables that hold data for an object.

Methods: Functions defined within a class that describe the behavior of the objects.

Encapsulation: Wrapping the data (attributes) and methods that work on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.

Inheritance: A way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. It helps reuse code.

Polymorphism: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even when they're part of a child class.

Polymorphism: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even when they're part of a child class.

Abstraction: Hiding the implementation details from the user, exposing only the essential parts.

Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism): When a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.

Method Overloading (Compile-Time Polymorphism): Python doesn't support method overloading directly, but it can be simulated using default or variable-length arguments.
